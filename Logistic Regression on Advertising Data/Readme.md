## Logistic Regression Project
In this project I have worked ona fake advertising data that takes in many numerical and text features and tells us if a particular user clicked on an advertisement or not.
I have worked only with the numerical features in this project. You can work on the the text features as well ( I think you'll get more meaningful inferences from the model on processing the
 ad-labels). The dataset csv file is also uploaded.
