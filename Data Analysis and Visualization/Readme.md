# Fandango Movie Ratings Analysis - 2015

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the movie ratings provided by Fandango in the year 2015, focusing on potential biases in their ratings. By comparing Fandango's ratings with those from other popular movie review platforms like Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, we investigate whether Fandango consistently rated movies higher than other platforms, and explore specific cases where significant discrepancies were observed.

## Dataset

The data used in this analysis was collected from Fandango's website in 2015. The dataset includes:

- Movie titles
- Fandango star ratings
- User ratings
- No of user votes for the movie

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

1. **Analyze Fandango's movie ratings** to identify any significant biases.
2. **Compare Fandango's ratings with those from other platforms** like ImDB, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes.
3. **Visualize the differences** in ratings to highlight any discrepancies.
4. **Discuss the implications** of these findings, particularly focusing on consumer trust and rating reliability.

## Key Findings

- **Fandango's Bias:** The analysis suggests that Fandango often rated movies higher than what users and other platforms did.
- **Case Study:** A notable example is a movie that received an overall rating of 1.86 across other platforms but was rated 4 stars on Fandango.
